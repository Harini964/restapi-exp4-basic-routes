The screenshots below demonstrate the successful implementation and testing of RESTful API routes in our Express.js application using tools like Postman:

✅ GET /api/books – Retrieves the list of all books stored in the in-memory database.

✅ POST /api/books – Adds a new book record with the provided title and author, returning the created book with a unique ID.

✅ PUT /api/books/:id – Updates an existing book’s details by ID, reflecting changes to the title and author.

✅ DELETE /api/books/:id – Deletes a book by ID and confirms the removal.

These screenshots validate that the CRUD operations are working correctly, handling requests and providing appropriate responses like 200 OK and 201 Created.
